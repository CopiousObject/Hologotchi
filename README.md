# Hologotchi
_A Portal To Your Holo-Pal_

Hologotchi is a new take on the original Tamagotchi. It caters to the same aspects of nurturing and interacting with a digital companion that will grow up as you care for it. With daily activities like feeding and playing, your Holo-Pal will evolve and learn new behaviors. By taking good care of your pal, new traits can arise, and the emotional bond between you and your holographic friend will grow and shape into companionship for a lifetime.

**Core Loop:**
- Care - Users will provide virtual food, energy, or "care" to their Holo-Pal, initiating interaction. Care includes playing, like throwing a ball for a dog, etc.
- Respond - The Holo-Pal reacts with animations, sounds, or changes in behavior, reflecting its current state, or sending a notification to the user to remind them about certain needs for themself and the user, allowing a deeper connection.
- Grow - Based on care and interaction, the Holo-Pal evolves, gaining new traits or abilities, with the potential to lose some. Opportunities to have the Holo-Pal bond and make memories with the user are the key premise for growth.
- Surprise - Unexpected events or rewards happen, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Memories are recalled or reenacted by the Holo-Pal.

**Why Holographic/Spatial Display?**
The holographic medium allows users to interact with Holo-Pal in three dimensions, creating a sense of presence and realism that flat screens lack. Users can view their companion from multiple angles, walk around it, and engage with it in a shared physical space. 
This interaction enhances emotional connection and immersion by making the playerâ€™s Holo-Pal feel like a tangible, living entity. The holographic display supports natural gestures and spatial awareness, enabling playful and intuitive interactions that deepen user engagement. Unlike flat screens, the holographic experience seamlessly transports the user between digital fantasy and the real world, making it more magical and memorable. While not immediately accessible, a desktop app could allow users to use it regardless of a holographic display.
